Feature matching:
Different implementations for extracting features are available such as Harris corner detection, SURF and SIFT. 
The feature matching by Corner Harris gave very few correspondences while those by SURF gave too many correspondences due to which SIFT was used

image resizing: a rescaling of the images was done before using feature matching and projection to reduce the computation time

histogram equalisation step: A contrast enhancement and histogram equalisation step was used in the final stage of mosaicing and interpolation example
This is in order to bring both the images to the same dynamic range and improve the contrast in case the dynamic ranges of the two images is very different
