Instructions

All the test images are supplied in the folder marked test_images
Run the code RangeData.m


Part_1
 

The input images are in range data format, they are converted into x,y,z tuples where z is the range information and fed to the function

Functions used 

1.calculate curvatures: Takes the input at x,y,z tuples and calculates the K,H,Pmin,Pmax curvatures from the principles of Monge patches.

Results would be stored in the vectors K,H,Pmin and Pmax which are arrays of images with K(1) being gaussian curvatures for img 1,K(2) being gaussian curvatures for img 2 and so on


Part_2

Based on the calculated curvatures in part 1 local topology is characterised
Functions used 

1.characterise_topology:takes the input as the K,H,Pmax and Pmin and characterises each pixel based on the local topology using the look up tables. Output x is based on characterisation using K and H while y (second argument) is based on Pmin and Pmax. For each of the images pairs of characterisations x(i),y(i) are created.

Each pixel of the output image is characterised as:

in y
1 peak
2 ridge
3 saddle
4 ridge 
5 flat
6 valley
7 saddle 
8 valley
9 pit

in x
1 peak
2 ridge
3 saddle ridge
4 none
5 flat
6 minimal surface
7 pit
8 valley
9 saddle valley

for visualisation at the output the images generated by x and y can be done by creating a mask from each case 
for eg. for peak run imshow(y==1), for valley run imshow(y==6 or y==8)

Note: 
1.Disconnected regions (points) are returned for each topology by the characterisation. Changing the threshold for the characterisation
eg instead of 0 using a range (-a,a) for -1 (-inf,-a) could improve the characterisation
2. Some of the topologies may not be present in the image in which case no pixels are marked by the corresponding number
3. Unmarked pixels remain as 0s 

Part_3

Region growing

1.region_Grow: Takes inputs as the image to be characterised and the initial seed points as second and third arguments
  However, this has not been implemented in the main code due to unreliable seed points obtained from the topology chracterisation step
